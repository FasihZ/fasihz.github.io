about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Iâ€™m a client success manager at Trademor x Alibaba, a writing consultant at the Academic Writing Center at IBA, and a Teacher Assistant. I'm doing my Bachelor's of Science in ***Econ & Math at IBA***, Karachi, with a ***3.91 CGPA***. I'm also the CFO of the ***Animal Welfare Society*** at IBA.  
    
  Having ***self-studied*** for my A-levels and secondary education due to financial constraints, I'm also a proud autodidact. A distinction holder in A-level Economics in Pakistan and was awarded a scholarship by Professor Tyler Cowen, Mercatus Center, to pursue Economics.   
    
  I ruminate on all sorts of weird things at my blog Pakonomist. I've also done multiple projects of model optimization on R and Excel. Aside from academics and work, I invest and powerlift. Also a big football fan and was part of a club, GSA, for 6 years. Super into travelling and Philosophy, particularly Stoicism and Absurdism. And dogs. I love dogs.

  <i class="fas fa-plane"></i> <mark>Why travelling?</mark> I love to travel because it allows you to be in cultures much different than yours. Plus I love tasting new foods :D

  <i class="fas fa-dumbbell"></i> <mark>Why Powerlifting?</mark> Helps me push myself to new limits. When you have 250 lbs on your back and you squat down, there is always a chance you will fail. Your knees might strain, or worse, break. Conquering that fear is why I love powerlifting.

          Lipton, Summer of 2023 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Made an interactive and live dashboard on Power Bi and Excel that can show how many of Lipton's different SKUs are available at each of their 8 DCs and analyze where we are under or over stocked. Made it simple and easy to read.
