about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Iâ€™m a client success manager at Trademor x Alibaba, a writing consultant at the Academic Writing Center at IBA, and a Teacher Assistant. I'm doing my Bachelor's of Science in ***Econ & Math at IBA***, Karachi, with a ***3.91 CGPA***. I'm also the CFO of the ***Animal Welfare Society*** at IBA.  
    
  Having ***self-studied*** for my A-levels and secondary education due to financial constraints, I'm also a proud autodidact. A distinction holder in A-level Economics in Pakistan and was awarded a scholarship by Professor Tyler Cowen, Mercatus Center, to pursue Economics.   
    
  I ruminate on all sorts of weird things at my blog Pakonomist. I've also done multiple projects of model optimization on R and Excel. Aside from academics and work, I invest and powerlift. Also a big football fan and was part of a club, GSA, for 6 years. Super into travelling and Philosophy, particularly Stoicism and Absurdism. And dogs. I love dogs.

  <i class="fas fa-plane"></i> <mark>Why travelling?</mark> I love to travel because it allows you to be in cultures much different than yours. Plus I love tasting new foods :D

  <i class="fas fa-dumbbell"></i> <mark>Why Powerlifting?</mark> Helps me push myself to new limits. When you have 250 lbs on your back and you squat down, there is always a chance you will fail. Your knees might strain, or worse, break. Conquering that fear is why I love powerlifting.
