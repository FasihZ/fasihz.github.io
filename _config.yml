about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Iâ€™m a ***Client Success Manager at Trademor x Alibaba***, a student, and an aspiring data analyst.   

  Having ***self-studied*** for my secondary education due to financial constraints, I'm a proud autodidact. A ***distinction holder in A-level Economics*** in Pakistan and was awarded a scholarship by Professor Tyler Cowen, Mercatus Center, to pursue Economics.
      
  Aside from academics and work, I'm a big football fan and was part of a club, GSA, for 6 years. Super into travelling and Philosophy, particularly Stoicism and Absurdism. And dogs. I love dogs.

  <i class="fas fa-plane"></i> <mark>Why travelling?</mark> I love to travel because it allows you to be in cultures much different than yours. Plus I love tasting new foods :D

  <i class="fas fa-dumbbell"></i> <mark>Why Powerlifting?</mark> Helps me push myself to new limits. When you have 250 lbs on your back and you squat down, there is always a chance you will fail. Your knees might strain, or worse, break. Conquering that fear is why I love powerlifting.

  <mark>Education</mark>  
  ***Qualification***: BS Econonomics & Mathematics at IBA  
  With a specialization in ***Business Intelligence***.
  
  ***CGPA***: 3.91
  
  The CFO of the ***Animal Welfare Society*** at IBA, Karachi.
