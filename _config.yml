about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Iâ€™m a client success manager at Trademor x Alibaba, a writing consultant at the Academic Writing Center at IBA, and a Teacher Assistant. I'm doing my Bachelor's of Science in Econ/Math at IBA, Karachi, with a 3.91 GPA. I'm also the CFO of the Animal Welfare Society at IBA.  
    
  Having self-studied for my A-levels and secondary education due to financial constraints, I'm also a proud autodidact. A distinction holder in A-level Economics in Pakistan and was awarded a scholarship by Professor Tyler Cowen, Mercatus Center, to pursue Economics.   
    
  I ruminate on all sorts of weird things at my blog Pakonomist. I've also done multiple projects of model optimization on R and Excel. Aside from academics and work, I invest and powerlift. Also a big football fan and was part of a club, GSA, for 6 years. Super into Philosophy, particularly Stoicism and Absurdism. And dogs. I love dogs.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
