    Built a ***live dashboard*** that shows a complete inventory anaysis of each of Lipton's SKUs.  
    
    Worked with the Lipton team during my internship to consolidate data and deliver a dashboard that can be utilized even after my internship ends.  
    
    Used ***Excel and Macros (VBA)*** to automate the dashboard.  
    
    The dashboard displays the inventory (tons), sales (tons) and the ***DOH of each SKU*** in each DC.

    An Excel-based dashboard that is fully interactive and automated with Macros enabled (via VBA).  
    
    As part of the Supply Chain dept, I came up with a Master Planning Schedule (MPS) that shows opening stock, closing stock, target inventory, predicted demand, and orders for each SKU.  
    
    The ***MPS*** also shows the capacity and shift plan of each machine that is producing each of Lipton's SKUs in all weeks YTG.  
    
    The Supply Planning Dashboard provides a ***one-shot view of the capacity utilization of each of the 11 machines***. It also shows future utilizations so that the supply planner can see ***choking points*** for each machine and shift some production earlier.

    With a dataset of current Airbnb prices, I split the dataset into train and test sets and ***performed EDA on R***, coming up with many illumanating visualizations.  
    
    Ran different types of regressions, such as ***MLR, Logistic Regression, Step-wise regression***, to predict Airbnb listings' prices.  

    Tweaked parameters of the model to further increase R^2, decrease Mape, and improve predictive KPIs of the model.  
    
    Did Classification too (via RParts on R) and then ***regularization (L1, Lass)*** to further improve model and lastly evaluated more KPIs such as ***Precision, Recall, and F1-Score***.
