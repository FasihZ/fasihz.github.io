    Built a live dashboard that shows a complete inventory anaysis of each of Lipton's SKUs.  
    
    Worked with the Lipton team during my internship to consolidate data and deliver a dashboard that can be utilized even after my internship ends.  
    
    Used Excel and Macros (VBA) to automate the dashboard.  
    
    The dashboard displays the inventory (tons), sales (tons) and the DOH of each SKU in each DC.

    Displays current and future (predicted) Machines' Utilization in each factory of Lipton 
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    An Excel-based dashboard that is fully interactive and automated with Macros enabled (via VBA).  
    
    As part of the Supply Chain dept, I came up with a Master Planning Schedule (MPS) that shows opening stock, closing stock, target inventory, predicted demand, and orders for each SKU.  
    
    The MPS also shows the capacity and shift plan of each machine that is producing each of Lipton's SKUs in all weeks YTG.  
    
    The Supply Planning Dashboard provides a one-shot view of the capacity utilization of each of the 11 machines. It also shows future utilizations so that the supply planner can see choking points for each machine and shift some production earlier.

    Working daily to have the system healthy and a backend without any major issues is a ***big challenge*** when you work ***in a company that receives millions of transactions per day***.
    Besides of developing new features or fixing some bugs, part of my routine is to verify reports, check the performance graphics, write documentation and release our services to production.

    This experience was my first part of Blip experience. I did the same tasks as I described above...the only difference is that I was part of a project to ***migrate a monolithic architecture
    software to a microservice architecture***. It was a very good experience that involved migrating code and restructuring a huge pipeline with a lot of dependencies in small pieces.

    It was a very interesting project! The main focus of the project was to build a system that allowed to collect metrics from the electric cars and with those metrics obtain some conclusions about CO2 release
    and the impact for the world. I worked as a backend developer in this project, it was the first time I had an experience with microservices and the ***opportunity to introduce the spring
    framework into the backend department*** (the team was really small and we had space to try new technologies or tools around the company).
